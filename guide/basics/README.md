# Creating your project

## Github
Github is a great place to share & collaborate on your code! You can use it to host your project's code. You can create a repository at [github.new](https://github.new/). Once you have generated your repository (creating a repository is optional), you can clone your repository to your computer by opening your terminal and typing:

```shell
# Replace the URL
git clone https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
```

## Locally
You don't have to use GitHub. You can create a folder on your computer locally by opening your terminal and typing:

```shell
# You can change awesome-trivia-project to whatever you want!
mkdir awesome-trivia-project
```

## Code Editor
We recommend using a code editor to edit your code! You can use editors like:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) is user-friendly, concise, and easy to navigate.
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) Text is another popular editor that's easy to use and write code.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a prevalent choice; it is known for being fast and powerful. It supports various languages, has a terminal, built-in IntelliSense support, and autocomplete for JavaScript and TypeScript. Visual Studio Code is the recommended choice.
