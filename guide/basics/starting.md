# Project files
Once you have created your main directory you can start adding files to it!

## Index File
An index file is the "main" file of your project you will probably run this most of the time.

You can create an index file by using the terminal and typing:

```shell
touch index.js
```

If you're coding in .js you should **always** add a `.js` at the end of your file name. (e.g. `index.js`) If you don't Node.js won't run your file!
